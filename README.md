# ðŸ“˜ Digital Trade Governance â€“ PhD Thesis Repository (2017â€“2024)

This repository hosts the full dataset, models, and interpretive artifacts developed during the doctoral research of **Dr. Lex Bustos Frati** (UBA, 2025), titled:

> **"International Regimes on Digital Trade: State Preferences over Regulatory Coordination in the WTO and Their Determinants (2017â€“2024)"**

It includes the complete empirical strategy, analytical models, visual interfaces, and semantic infrastructures derived from the thesis, with a special focus on the WTOâ€™s **Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce (JSI / IDCCE)**.

## ðŸŽ“ About the Thesis

**Core question:**  
Why do some states opt into exclusive digital trade negotiations (IDCCE), while others remain within the traditional multilateral channel (PTCE)?

**Scope:**  
- 164 WTO Member States
- 3 analytical time points (2017, 2019, 2024)
- Mixed methods (logistic regression + content coding of 130+ documents)
- Adaptation of Moravcsikâ€™s three-step model of state preferences

## ðŸ§  Analytical Model: Three-Step Framework

| Step | Dimension | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Step 1** | Substantive Cooperation | Structural capacities & institutional advantages |
| **Step 2** | Institutional Choice | Strategic motivations (credibility, technocracy, ideology) |
| **Step 3** | Negotiation Core | Dual architecture: tariff moratorium & regulatory space |

This logic is implemented both in statistical models and in interactive visualizations.
